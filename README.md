INTRODUCTION:
	I have selected (Build a online UML Editor) for development role. I have used (html, css,  javascript, Nodejs) as  frontend,  ( Mongodb) as Backend, And Gojs library for creating uml diagrams.

DATABASE:
	I have used Mongodb as Backend ,Mongodb is a NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents. Documents store related information together and use the MongoDB query language (MQL) for access. Fields can vary from document to document - there is no need to declare the structure of documents to the system, as documents are self describing.Optionally, schema validation can be used to enforce data governance controls over each collection.

NODE JS:
	Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtimeNode.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.
GOJS LIBRARY:
	GoJS is a JavaScript library that lets you easily create interactive diagrams in modern web browsers. GoJS supports graphical templates and data-binding of graphical object properties to model data. You only need to save and restore the model, consisting of simple JavaScript objects holding whatever properties your app needs. Many predefined tools and commands implement the standard behaviors that most diagrams need. Customization of appearance and behavior is mostly a matter of setting properties.so I have used gojs library for creating uml diagrams.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
We can create UML diagram in online as well can create a account by signup the form and create diagrams(activity diagram, usecase diagram,basicflowchart ). we can drag and drop the shape from the panel for creating a complete diagram. we can save the diagram by save button that will help for future use ,finally the diagram can be converted to a image.
